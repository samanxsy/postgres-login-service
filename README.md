# Template Project
Automated environment setup and Template for my Python projects

## Setting up the environment
#### if you want to use this repo as a template, just click on the green "Use this template" button on the top right of this repo. Then clone "your" repository that's made by this template on your local machine (linux/macOS), run the commands below and follow the instructions.
just make sure you have python installed
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
chmod +x devenv-setup.sh
./devenv-setup.sh
```
### Do NOT clone THIS repository
use it as a template to create your own, then clone your own repo and start working. Cheers.
